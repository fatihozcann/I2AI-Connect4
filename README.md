# Algorithm Comparison for Connect4 AI Game

This project presents a comparison of algorithms for the Connect4 AI game, developed for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Eskişehir Osmangazi University (Course Code: 152117107). The project is conducted under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Savaş Okyay.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of various AI algorithms when applied to the Connect4 game. Each algorithm pair (e.g., Minimax vs. Monte Carlo Tree Search) is compared based on:

- **Memory Usage**: The amount of memory consumed by each algorithm.
- **Execution Time**: The time taken to make decisions in each scenario.

## Algorithms Compared

The project includes comparisons between different AI algorithms, with a focus on both resource efficiency and computational performance.

## Results

Results are presented with memory usage and time spent for each comparison to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

## Supervisor

Asst. Prof. Savaş Okyay
